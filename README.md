## Eventbrite Post & CRM/Hubspot E-mail Template
Once main project image was approved, Eventbrite and Hubspot templates were created. Hubspot evite was linked to Eventbrite Posting.
Although Eventbrite, has its own built in CRM services, Hubspot was preferred by client. Click on Image for better view.

## Event Signage
### 2 Events Signs were created:
Greeting Signage and a Celebrating a life well lived, Catherine Duster Enns Sign were both formated for Standard Poster Board.
Please note that although Celebrating a life well lived, Catherine Duster Enns design was approved for use, copy/ bio  was never provided therefore never updated. Due to venue rules, signage was scrapped from event design.
