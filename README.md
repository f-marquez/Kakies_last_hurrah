# Katie's Last Hurrah
### Celebration of Life 

## Overview

Katie's Last Hurrah! , is a celebration of Catherine Duster Enns's life that will to be held at the Backus Art Museum & Gallery in Ft Pierce, Florida.
As a long time board member of the museum and patron of the arts, Katie willed a beloved Backus painting to the museum upon on her death. Orignally the celebration &  painting dedication were set to be held a year after her passing but due to social distancing concerns presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, they had to be postponed until it was safe to gather once more.


The designs included here are fully redesigned and are different than those of the original event.

### Inspiration for Design

Delightful and smart witted - she was impossible to forget. Wife to editor of the news paper, Mother to a league of 8, and teacher for over 5 decades she left an undeniable mark on her community. She had a gift for creating spaces where others could feel seen. 

I created a designed that reflected her bright personality while paying tribute to life she shared with her friends and family in Florida.
